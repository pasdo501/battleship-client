# Battleship

Client side code for a battleship app making use of websockets for communication between players.

Currently deployed on [Surge](https://surge.sh).

_Note:_ after running `yarn build`, make sure to rename the `index.html` file to `200.html` so Surge can handle it as a fallback and make sure the React router works.

See [README2](./README2.md) for CRA specific readme.
